PWK 03 - Essential Tools

- We often encounter situations we do not fully understand. We wish to uncover more information.

Netcat: Versatile tool, can read and write to TCP and UDP ports. Runs in two modes, client and server.

---Connecting to a Port---

Why connect to a port?
1. Check if a port is open or closed.
2. Read a banner from the port.
3. Connect to a network service manually.

Example: Use netcat to check if TCP port 80 (HTTP) is open.
	nc -nv 10.11.1.72 80

- If port is open, we can converse with service using netcat.

---Listening on a Port---

Why listen on a port?
1. Network debugging client applications.
2. Receiving a TCP/UDP connection.

Example: Use netcat to connect to session on port 4444
	nc -nlvp 4444 (open session on server)
	nc -nv 10.11.20.127 4444 (connect to session from client)

1. Which machine acted as the netcat server?
	- The server is the machine listening for a connection on port 4444.

2. Which machine acted as the netcat client?
	- The client is the machine connecting over port 4444

3. On which machine was port 4444 actually opened?
	- The server.

4. Switches: 
	l: listen mode
	n: no DNS lookup, numeric-only
	v: verbose
	p: local port number

---Transferring Files---

What is going on?
- We are able to transfer files, both text and binary, from one computer to another.
- We can setup a netcat listener and redirect incoming input into a file.

Example: Use netcat to connect to listener and redirect input to incoming.exe file. Push wget.exe
	nc -nlvp 4444 > incoming.exe (listener)
	nc -nv 10.11.20.127 4444 < /usr/share/windows-binaries/wget.exe
